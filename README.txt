This program calculates the triplet entanglement associated with two triplet
excitations born out of ultrafast singlet fission.  

Compile using Makefile (make all, make install, make clean).  

MMax.py will average the entanglement for a singlet excitation
nearly resonant with two triplet excitations, calculated by entanglement.py.
